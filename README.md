## Get the Project

- [ ] [Go to the repository in github](https://github.com/sergio266/Front-Personal-Web-MERN.git) and review the project structure, you can download it the *.zip* or just use the command:

```
cd folder_location
git clone https://github.com/sergio266/Front-Personal-Web-MERN.git
```


## Project Dependencies

- ***`React:`*** It is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like *Nextjs*.

- ***`React-Dom:`*** It is a package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app and as an escape hatch to get outside the React model if you need to

- ***`Typescript:`*** It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.

- ***`Eslint:`*** It is a static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. Rules in ESLint are configurable, and customized rules can be defined and loaded. ESLint covers both code quality and coding style issues.

- ***`Vitest:`*** It is a blazing fast unit test framework to JavaScript powered by Vite. It has a great integration with Jest since it is strongly inspired by it. So migrating from Jest is very easy and fast.

- ***`Vite:`*** It is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts: a dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules and a build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

- ***`Babel:`*** It is a free and open-source JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into backwards-compatible JavaScript code that can be run by older JavaScript engines.

- ***`React-Router-Dom:`*** It is an npm package that enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app. It allows you to display pages and allow users to navigate them. It is a fully-featured client and server-side routing library for React. React Router Dom is used to build single-page applications i.e. applications that have many pages or components but the page is never refreshed instead the content is dynamically fetched based on the URL.

- ***`Axios:`*** It is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node.js or XMLHttpRequests from the browser and it supports the Promise API that is native to JS ES6. It can be used intercept HTTP requests and responses and enables client-side protection against XSRF. It also has the ability to cancel requests..

- ***`Formik:`*** It is a small group of React components and hooks for building forms in React and React Native. It helps with the three most annoying parts: getting values in and out of form state, validation and error messages, handling form submission.

- ***`Yup`*** It is a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation. Define a schema, transform a value to match, validate the shape of an existing value, or both. Yup schema are extremely expressive and allow modeling complex, interdependent validations or value transformations.


## Project Scripts

- *"format":* Running this script will format all of the project's code using the Prettier tool under the parameters set in its configuration file.

- *"lint":* Running this script you will be able to print to the terminal all those errors and warnings thrown by es-lint, after analyzing the project code according to its configuration.

- *"lint-fix":* Running this script you will allow es-lint to fix as many errors and warnings as possible and print the remaining errors and warnings to the terminal, after analyzing the project's code according to its configuration.

- *"dev":* Runs the application in development mode. Start a local server to view the project in the browser. If you make changes to the code, Vite will rerender only those components that have been updated. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

- *"build":* When it is time to deploy your app for production, simply run this script. By default, it uses '*root/index.html*' as the build entry point, and produces an application bundle that is suitable to be served over a static hosting service. For more information visit [Building for Production - Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)

- *"preview":* Is a CLI utility that can be used to preview Vite projects in a production-like environment. It builds the project, starts a production server, and opens a browser to the server URL.
